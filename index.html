                <strong><em> The ocean liner’s actual wreck is shown in the film</em></strong>
                <p>In the film’s early scenes, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and his crew descend to a depth of more than 4,000 metres (13,120 feet)
                     to get a closer look at the Titanic. Incredibly, some of the images shown on screen come from the real wreck, 
                     which James Cameron explored many times in preparation for the film. 
                     These shots of the Titanic were filmed with a special camera that could withstand the pressure down at the ocean floor. 
                     The real images of the famous ship were then completed with studio shots using models.
                </p>
                <strong><em>No, Leonardo DiCaprio isn’t actually drawing in Titanic</em></strong>
                <p>
                    This information might disappoint some fans, but no, Leonardo DiCaprio wasn’t the one drawing in the film. 
                    In this scene, which has since become a classic, where Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) draws Rose (Kate Winslet) lying naked in front of him, 
                    the actor is unfortunately not the one who actually does the drawing. Leonardo turned out to be dreadful at drawing, 
                    and he was unable to correctly trace the lines requested by the director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    James Cameron solved this problem himself. Indeed, the hands filmed in close-up during this sequence are actually the director’s own. 
                    This trick required some editing in post-production: James Cameron being left-handed, 
                    he had to reverse the shot in order to make the scene consistent.
