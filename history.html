                <h3>What happened? </h3>

                    The RMS Titanic, a luxury steamship, sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden voyage. Of the 2,240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 lost their lives in the disaster. 
                    Titanic has inspired countless books, articles and films (including <a href = "summary.html" > the 1997 “Titanic” movie </a> starring <a href = "characters.html#Kate Winslet"> Kate Winslet</a> and <a href="characters.html#Leonardo DiCaprio"> Leonardo DiCaprio</a>), 
                    and the ships story has entered the public consciousness as a cautionary tale about the perils of human hubris.

                    The Titanic was the product of intense competition among rival shipping lines in the first half of the 20th century. 
                    In particular, the White Star Line found itself in a battle for steamship primacy with Cunard, 
                    a venerable British firm with two standout ships that ranked among the most sophisticated and luxurious of their time.

                    Cunard’s Mauretania began service in 1907 and quickly set a speed record for the fastest average speed during a transatlantic crossing (23.69 knots or 27.26 mph),

                    Cunard’s other masterpiece, Lusitania, launched the same year and was lauded for its spectacular interiors. 
                    Lusitania met its tragic end on May 7, 1915, when a torpedo fired by a German U-boat sunk the ship, 
                    killing nearly 1,200 of the 1,959 people on board and precipitating the United States’ entry into World War I.
